# Intro2R

This repository contains teaching materials for an introductory workshop to R programming. It is designed for those with minimal coding experience, and is meant to be a crash-course where you get a taste of what R can do. An overview of the workshop and slide decks can be viewed in this [blogpost](https://xp-song.github.io/posts/intro2r/).

Please note that this course is not meant to be a lesson in statistics, or to substitute practicing the fundamentals of the language. There are many online resources in R which I highly recommend. Links to these materials are provided in the notes and slides.

## Workshop outline:

1. R Environment and Syntax
    - [Notes](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/xp-song/Intro2R/blob/master/notes/1_R_environ_and_syntax.html)
    - [Slide deck](https://xp-song.github.io/posts/intro2r/assets/Intro2r_1/1_R_environ_and_syntax_slides#1)
2. Data Wrangling and Visualisation
    - [Notes](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/xp-song/Intro2R/blob/master/notes/2_Data_wrangling_and_visualisation.html)
    - [Slide deck](https://xp-song.github.io/posts/intro2r/assets/Intro2r_2/2_Data_wrangling_and_visualisation_slides#1)


## Instructions:

Before the workshop, please install [R](https://cran.r-project.org) onto your computer, followed by [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). After doing so, [download the materials for this workshop](https://github.com/xp-song/Intro2R/archive/master.zip) from the Github repository [Intro2R](https://github.com/xp-song/Intro2R).

In the downloaded folder you will see a few important items. 

* The slide deck in PDF format.

* The _'notes'_ folder. View course notes in your web browser by opening the **.html** files.   

* The _'data'_ folder. It contains example datasets we will use in this workshop.

* The _'output'_ folder. When generating outputs (i.e. figures, graphs), we will specify in our code to export files to this location. 

* The RStudio Project file (ending with _.Rproj_). Opening it boots up RStudio.
