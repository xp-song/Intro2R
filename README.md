# Intro2R

This repository contains teaching materials for an introductory 3-hour workshop to R. It is designed for those with minimal coding experience. It introduces the basics of R and the RStudio IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Just like how Microsoft Word as a software application provides many more functions than a basic text editor, an IDE provides comprehensive facilities for coding.

This workshop is designed to be a crash-course. We will thus spend more time using R to organise, visualise, and perform statistical analyses on data. Hopefully this will help kick-start your journey to becoming more data-savvy :) There are many comprehensive online courses in R that cover the fundamentals of the language, which I highly recommend. Links to these materials will be provided.

## Workshop outline:

1. R environment and syntax
2. Data types and structures
3. Data wrangling and visualisations
4. Statistical analyses
5. Other useful packages


Before the workshop, please install the most recent versions of [R](https://cran.r-project.org) and [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) onto your computer. After doing so, [download the materials for this workshop from the Github repo Intro2R](https://github.com/xp-song/Intro2R/archive/master.zip).
