# Intro2R

This repository contains teaching materials for an introductory workshop to R programming. It is designed for those with minimal coding experience, and is meant to be a crash-course where you get a taste of what R can do. An overview of the workshop and slide decks can be viewed in this [blogpost](https://xp-song.github.io/posts/intro2r/).

Please note that this course is not meant to be a lesson in statistics, or to substitute practicing the fundamentals of the language. There are many online resources in R which I highly recommend. Links to these materials are provided in the notes and slides.


## Workshop outline:

1. Getting started
2. General syntax
3. Data structures
4. Functions
5. The _tidyverse_
6. Useful resources
