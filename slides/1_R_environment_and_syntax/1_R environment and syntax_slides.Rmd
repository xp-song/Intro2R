# What is R?

- Programming language and software environment
- Started in the 1990s mainly for statistical analysis
- Command line interface
- RStudio is commonly used as a graphical user interface
- Both R and RStudio are open source software
- Many resources and help available online from large community of developers/users
- Huge (and growing) library of user-created _packages_ offer many functions beyond statistics (even to translate R to other languages!)


???

- Cmd line: unlike GUI-based software such as Excel, SPSS, etc.
- Rstudio: Just like how Microsoft Word provides many more functions than a basic text editor, RStudio provides many functions for coding.
- Huge library: make beautiful graphics, build websites, etc.

# About this crash course

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.height=70}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/RStudio-Logo-flat.svg")
```
  
We will work entirely with RStudio, and run our scripts in R Notebooks (*.Rmd* files)<sup>1</sup>, instead of basic R scripts (*.R* files).

<br>
  
**What are R Notebooks?**
- They are [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) documents that allow us to intersperse regular text with chunks of code
- They allow us to interact with our code and view outputs within a single document
- They can be '_knit_' into different file-types (i.e. Word, Slides, PDF, HTML, etc.)


.footnote[
[1] All materials in this course were created from _.Rmd_ files. We will work within these source files available in the _/notes_ folder. The course slides and their source files are located at _/slides_.

# Getting Started

1. [Download the materials for this workshop](https://github.com/xp-song/Intro2R/archive/master.zip) from the Github repository __Intro2R__  
https://github.com/xp-song/Intro2R  

2. Open up the RStudio Project file **_Intro2R.Rproj_**  

3. In the file browser (bottom-right panel), navigate to _/notes_ and open the R Notebook   
**_0_Getting started.Rmd_**

# R Studio Client

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width=650, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/RStudio.png")
```
* __Console:__ Command line input/output. All you would see if you ran R without RStudio.  
* __Script editor:__ View/edit files that contain code. Code can be sent to the console.
* __Environment/History:__ Shows all objects in R's memory. The history tab keeps track of past commands.
* __Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer__

???

- The console is more for real-time testing & interaction.  

- It is important to edit and save code within scripts 

- This is because we want to be able to replicate what we did in the past  



---

class: left

# R Studio Client

- Try creating a new R Notebook `File > New File > R Notebook`

--

- Try creating a new RStudio Project `File > New Project > New Directory > New Project`

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width=300, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/new project.png")
```

---

class: left

# R Studio Projects

The folder containing the RStudio Project is the 'working directory', where R inputs/outputs/saves information (data, documents, history, etc.)
  
- Type `getwd()` in the console of our new project
  
  - This returns the _absolute_ path to our working directory `/Users/<computer_username>/Desktop/test`

--

## 🌟 Best Practice

- Keep all project items within the folder containing the R Project file 

- Rather than using _absolute_ paths in our scripts, use **_relative_** paths

  - E.g. In the Intro2R Project console, we can read ozone data with either `read.delim("/<path to Intro2R folder>/Intro2R/data/ozone_data.txt")` or `read.delim("data/ozone_data.txt")`

- This allows scripts to work when we move the project around, even across different computers



???

- setwd(): manually specify the working directory

- RStudo Project file acts as a 'homing beacon', so we don't need to write out the initial path

- Close/delete the test project

## YAML Header
```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width=700, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/yaml.png")
```
  - Output is [HTML](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/xp-song/Intro2R/blob/master/notes/0_Getting_started.html)  
  - See [this online book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html) for examples of different parameters (for .html and other outputs) 

???

- YAML Ain't Markup Language
- Readable language commonly used for config files

# 0_Getting started.Rmd

## Code Chunks

- Add a new chunk: 
  - Using the mouse: `Insert` button
  - `Cmd+Option+I`.
- Run code chunk (_try it!_):
  - Using the mouse: `Run/Play` button
  - `Cmd+Shift+Enter` (cursor must be inside chunk)
  - `Cmd+Enter` (single line of code)
```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width=700, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/code chunk.png")
```

???

- Comments are not run as code
- You can name code chunks
- You can also set different parameters for each code chunk
- 'Knit' button: run all the code & re-generate the whole document

## Install packages

- [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/): Contains multiple packages commonly used for data analyses
  - [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org), [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org), [tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org), [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org), [purr](https://purrr.tidyverse.org), [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org)
- [rmarkdown](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/rmarkdown/versions/1.8): Next generation of R Markdown based on [pandoc](https://pandoc.org)  
- [knitr](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/knitr/versions/1.23): General purpose tool to knit reports from R Notebooks  

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width=550, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Image from medium.com"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tidyverse.png")
```

???

- The tidyverse is a collection of packages that share an underlying design philosophy:
  - language structure, data structures
- We will not be using all of these packages in this workshop

# R Environment and Syntax

Open **1_R environment and syntax.Rmd**  in the _/notes_ folder

Load packages with <span style="color:black">`library("<package_name>")`</span>

# Objects in R

.left-column[ 
### Syntax
]
.right-column[ 
**Variables**
- Used to store data
- Data types: _Numeric, character, integer, logical (T/F) or complex_
- Assign a variable `x <- 4` (arrow shortcut: `Option/Alt`+`-`)  
- Words (characters) must be within quotation marks `"hello"` 
] 
--
.right-column[ 
**🌟Best Practice**
- `x = 4` and ` x <- 4` produce similar results
- However, code consistency is important
- In R, we use `<-` as an assignment operator, and `=` for arguments within functions 
- Spacing is also important for readability e.g. `myvar<-4` ☹️   
- Naming should be consistent/clear (case sensitive, no numbers/symbols/whitespace). E.g. treeHeight_m, species_count
]

???

- try assigning a variable, call it myvar
- variable should appear in your environment

**Vectors**
- Sequential collection of data of the _same_ type
- Coercion occurs if different types are mixed
- Asking and coercion can be done manually to change the vector (data) type

# Objects in R

.right-column[
**Lists**
- Consist of different elements (i.e. variables/vectors) that _can be of different types_ 
- E.g. `mylist <- list(num_vec, char_vec, 1, "hello")`
- Elements in a list are indexed with [[]], individual items are in []
```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width=1000, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/lists.png")

**Factors**
- Used to represent categorical, ordinal, or even binary data
- Can be coded as character or numeric
- Some examples:
  - Tom, Dick, Harry
  - Blue, Black, Brown (eye color)
  - High, Medium, Low (3, 2, 1)
  - SD, D, Neutral, A, SA (-2:2)
  - Male, Female (1, 2)

- Data in rectangular format (2D array with rows & columns)
- Data must be of the _same_ type!
- More memory efficient than dataframes

In the figure, name all the objects that could be the following data structures:  
__List, Matrix, Vector__

- Matrix: Everything expcept df

- Vector: Everything
