# R Notebooks
This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. It allows you to generate different types of output (i.e. reports, presentations, dashboards). The notebook begins with a 'YAML header' bordered by three hyphens (top & bottom). It determines the type of output that R will build from the _.Rmd_ file. In this case, it is an *html_document*.

R Markdown closely follows the syntax of regular markdown (a language used for plain text formatting). Some basic formatting capabilities can be found [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html). A full cheatsheet for R Markdown is available [here](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf).

**Code chunks:**  

* When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.  

* Add a new chunk by clicking *Insert > R* in the toolbar above, or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

* Try executing the following chunk by clicking the *Run/Play* button, or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. Press *Cmd+Enter* to run a single line of code.

```{r}
#comments (following hashtags) are not run as code
print("Hello, World!")
(1+1)/(1*1) #let's do some calculations
```

```{r hello, echo = FALSE}
#this code chunk is titled 'hello'
#it is not displayed in the output because of the 'echo = FALSE' parameter
#whatever code in this chunk will still be run, unless 'eval = FALSE' is added as a parameter
#other parameters can be found at https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/r-code.html
```

<br>

**R Notebook Outputs:**

* When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it.

* Clicking the *Knit* button will run all chunks in the notebook and generate a new file.

* Clicking the *Preview* button does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor will be displayed.

# Install Packages

We need to first install some essential R packages on your computer (you only need to do this once):

- [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/): Contains multiple packages commonly used for data analyses (i.e. dplyr, ggplot2, etc.)

- [rmarkdown](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/rmarkdown/versions/1.8): Next generation of R Markdown based on [pandoc](https://pandoc.org)

- [knitr](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/knitr/versions/1.23): General purpose tool to knit reports from R Notebooks 


```{r install_packages, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE}
#You can run these individually line-by-line using Cmd+Enter
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("rmarkdown")
install.packages("knitr")
```
